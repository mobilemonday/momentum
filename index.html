    q: "When is your next program and how do I apply?"
    a: "We have two batches graduate a year.  Apply anytime.  If you're accepted you start in the next batch, and if not then you can still be considered for a future batch.  Apply here. http://www.f6s.com/momentum.accelerator"
  - item:
    q: "Can anyone apply?"
    a: "Yes. Momentum is open to entrepreneurs from anywhere.  Your country of citizenship doesn’t matter. You country of residence doesn’t matter. Your gender doesn’t matter. All that matters is the quality of your team and the business opportunity you are pursuing.  We do provide letters of support for visas and logistical support in finding a residence in San Francisco."
  - item:
    q: "Does Momentum Cover Housing?"
    a: "Momentum does not personally cover the cost of housing or transportation for the program; however we will have a person that can help you find housing and try to make the move as painless as possible."
  - item:
    q: "What is the fee for joining the program and is it negotiable?"
    a: "Momentum takes up to 4% of common stock equity plus a flat $5,000 fee that is payable at the beginning of the program.  This is negotiable depending on the stage of the startup, and the terms must be negotiated before the program starts."
  - item:
    q: "What happens to alumni companies?"
    a: "Our alumni companies are treated like a portfolio company in a venture fund.  They will be invited to most social events and the advisors and office hours will be made available to them after the current class has chosen their slots.  The Momentum team is working on ways to improve the transition even more as we speak."
